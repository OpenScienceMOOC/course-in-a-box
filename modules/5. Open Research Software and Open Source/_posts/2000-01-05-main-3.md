## Collaborating and contributing through Open Source <a name="Collaborating"></a>

Often, OSS is developed in a public, decentralised, collaborative manner between multiple contributors. The purpose of this is to enhance the diversity and scope of a project and its design, in order to become more beneficial and sustainable. Such an approach was famously likened to a 'bazaar' model by Eric Raymond, an early OSS proponent. One of the major guiding principles of this is that of peer production, which relies on self-organised communities to regulate the development of content, co-ordinated towards a shared goal or outcome.

OSS projects rely heavily on volunteer collaboration, which often entails a constant flux of newcomers in order to become productive and sustainable ([Steinmacher et al., 2014](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-5-Open-Research-Software-and-Open-Source/blob/master/Reading%20Material_Open%20Source%20and%20Open%20Research%20Software/Steinmacher%20et%20al.%2C%202014.pdf)). Creating the right social atmosphere for a project, and a welcoming engagement environment, are often critical to successful collaboraitons in OSS.

## Where to go from here <a name="Future_OSS"></a>

Hopefully now you have come to see the importance of software as a cornerstone of modern science, and the importance that OSS plays in this.

The **learning outcomes** from this should be:

1. You will now be able to define the characteristics of OSS, and the ethical, legal, economic and research impact arguments for and against it.

2. Based on community standards, you will now be able to describe the quality requirements of sharing and re-using open code.

3. You will now be able to use a range of research tools that utilise OSS.

4. You will now be able to transform code designed for their personal use into code that is accessible and re-usable by others.

5. Software developers will be able to make their software citable, and software users will know how to cite the software they use.

<br/>

However, the Open Source journey does not stop here! This was just the beginning, and there are some incredible resources out there if you would like to do or learn more:

* If you feel particularly inspired by this, you can endorse the [Science Code Manifesto](http://sciencecodemanifesto.org/), which is based on the five principles of code, copyright, citation, credit, and curation.

* To launch and develop your own project, the [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/) program offers a range of practical guides and skills to help launch and advance your OSS projects.

* For a detailed look at OSS-based research workflows, the [Open Science, Open Data, Open Source](https://pfern.github.io/OSODOS/gitbook/) hand-guide by Pedro L. Fernandes and Rutger A. Vos is one of the top resources online.

* More formalised journal venues also exist for software-based articles, including [The Journal of Open Research Software](https://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/) and [The Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/).  A list of such venues is also [available](https://www.software.ac.uk/which-journals-should-i-publish-my-software).

* The [PLOS Open Source Toolkit](https://channels.plos.org/open-source-toolkit) provides a global forum for Open Source hardware and software research and applications.

* The [NumFOCUS](http://www.numfocus.org) is a nonprofit organization that supports and promotes world-class, innovative, open source scientific software. Some of the projects they sponsor include:
  
  * [IPython](http://ipython.org) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) initiatives.
  
  * [rOpenSci](http://ropensci.org), which promotes the open source R statistical environment for transparent and reproducible research.
  
  * To gain more hands on experience with OSS, the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) community holds regular workshops to improve lab-based computing skills ([Wilson et al., 2017](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-5-Open-Research-Software-and-Open-Source/blob/master/Reading%20Material_Open%20Source%20and%20Open%20Research%20Software/Wilson%20et%20al.%2C%202017.pdf)).
